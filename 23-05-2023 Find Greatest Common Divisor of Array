class Solution:
    def gcd(self,a,b):
        if a==0:
            return b
        return gcd(b%a,a)
    def findGCD(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a=max(nums)
        b=min(nums)
        return self.gcd(a,b)
       
       
       

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
