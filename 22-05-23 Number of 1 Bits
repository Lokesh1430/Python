class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        ct=0
        while n!=0:
            if (n&1)==1:
                ct+=1
            n=n>>1
        return ct
        

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
